<p><b>Lottery Smart Contract</b></p>

<p>This contract consists of a prize pool (collection of ether) and players.</p>
<p>Once a player has submitted money to the contract (prize pool) they will automatically be recorded as a player in the lottery. </p>
<p>Once enough people have entered the contract, a third party manager will TELL THE CONTRACT to pick a winner from the players</p>
<p>Once a winner is picked, all the money in the prize pool will be sent to the winning player.</p>
<p>At that point the contract will reset and will be ready to accept new players again.</p>
